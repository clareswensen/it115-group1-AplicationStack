# it115-group1-AplicationStack
Group Project: In this assignment students will work in groups on a project to utilize our application stack building and documentation skills.   Each group will select an application stack to build and create tutorials to build both the stack and a sample application that utilizes the stack as built by group.

The two tutorials need to separate, one for the stack, one for the application, but link to each other as they are a set.  The tutorials should likely start as google (or other) web documents, but ultimately could be web pages.

These tutorials must present any relevant code in a GitHub repo and a GitHub page must be built to promote the tutorials.

Submission: will be a link to a shared staging area named "Project Document" (google doc) with links to your work, which consists of the following:  

1) An application stack building tutorial document

2) A Hello world application tutorial to demonstrate your stack

3) A repo to store all code demonstrated

4) A Github page designed to show your work, present your repo and provide links to your tutorials

5) A post-project questionnaire/retrospective will be sent to each team member and is worth 25 points of the final grade.
